This is Noq's entrypoint in to your environment. As a security precaution, Noq assigns a random ExternalID to your tenant on Noq. We will always pass this ExternalId when assuming a role. If the ExternalId does not match, the assume role connection will not be permitted. Noq also has the capability to broker credentials to authorized users or groups for all other roles within your environment. To allow this, please enable credential brokering in the Settings page, and specify tags that Noq can use to identify the authorized users and groups allowed to access each role. The Central Role requires the following permissions: Permission Resource Purpose sts:AssumeRole ** Assume all Noq spoke roles across the customer's accounts. Assume all roles for the purpose of credential brokering (Note: This only works if the target roles allow the Central Role to call sts:AssumeRole and sts:TagSession within their Trust Policy.) sts:TagSession ** Allow Noq to pass session tags when performing a role assumption. Spoke Role Account Permissions Noq's spoke roles are assumed by the Noq central role to cache information about your accounts and cloud resources, and to update identity and resource policies. One spoke role should exist on each of your accounts, including the account that your central role resides on.

Note If accounts.allowlist is not specified, the rule will apply to policy requests on all AWS accounts. See Example Configuration for more examples. 2. Write and Save Rules to Configuration \u00b6 As an administrator, navigate to the Advanced/Config view in Noq's UI. This is your organization's configuration in Noq. Write and save the rule here. 3.

Download Weep for your operating system. \u00b6 On the Downloads page, scroll down to see the list of installers. Download the Weep installer for your operating system. 3. Copy the setup commands from the Downloads page \u00b6 The Downloads page includes setup commands specific to your Noq user. Copy the setup commands. You'll use them in the next step of this procedure. 4. Paste and run the setup commands \u00b6 Paste the setup commands into your command-line environment and run them. These commands will create a weep directory and configuration file. 5. Optional: Copy weep to your $PATH \u00b6 If you downloaded a Linux/Mac binary, copy Weep to your $PATH. cd ~/Downloads cp ./weep /usr/local/bin/weep 6. Authenticate your Weep client in Noq \u00b6 Run the following command to authenticate your weep client in Noq. weep list For example, if you run weep list in a bash shell, the Noq user interface will prompt you to approve the request by the Weep client to authenticate using your Noq user role. 7. Approve the credentials request \u00b6 Approve the authentication request from the Weep client by clicking the Approve Credential Request button in the Noq Web user interface. Upon approving the credentials request, you should see a response that lists the roles you are authorized to assume. Next Steps \u00b6 Run weep --help to explore the functionality Weep provides.

For examples requiring an email address, person name, company name, ip address, street address, or project name, see Example domains and names . Punctuation \u00b6 Use a comma before the last item in a series. This is known as the serial or Oxford comma. Avoid using semicolons. Write separate sentences instead. Don't use a slash (/) to present a choice among actions or objects. Pick one option or rephrase to eliminate the slash. Exceptions are established terms like client/server and read/write. Formatting and organization \u00b6 Use sentence case for page titles and section headings. Use numbered lists for sequences. Use bulleted lists for most other lists. Put code-related text in code font. Put UI elements in italics. Use universal and unambiguous date formatting. For example, 31 May 2022 . Images \u00b6 Use SVG files or crushed PNG images.

This enables those with accessibility needs and improves the overall experience for all readers. Use language that is inclusive of everyone. Guidelines \u00b6 Don't use ableist language. Ableist language includes words or phrases such as crazy , insane , blind to or blind eye to , cripple , dumb , and others. Don't describe people without disabilities as normal or healthy. Instead, use terms such as sighted person or person without disabilities . Write diverse and inclusive examples . Use a screen reader to test your documentation. To try out a screen reader, see List of screen readers . Avoid unnecessary font formatting. (Screen readers explicitly describe text modifications.) Avoid camel case and all caps. Some screen readers read capitalized letters individually. Screen readers don't read all punctuation marks. Make sure that the same meaning is conveyed to the reader without punctuation marks. Avoid the use of exclamation points, question marks, and semicolons. Ease of reading \u00b6 Break up walls of text to aid in scannability. Use short sentences (fewer than 26 words). Create small paragraphs (2-5 sentences). Use lists. Create headings. Use simple words in favor of complex words. For example, use start or begin instead of commence . Define acronyms and abbreviations on first usage. Write dates and times in universally recognized and unambiguous ways. Place distinguishing and important information of a paragraph in the first sentence to aid in scannability. Use clear and direct language. Avoid the use of double negatives and exceptions for exceptions. Recommended : You can continue without a path. Not recommended : A missing path won't prevent you from continuing. Headings and titles \u00b6 Use descriptive headings and titles because they help a user navigate the documentation site and individual pages. Use a heading hierarchy. Tag headings using heading elements. In Markdown: #, ##, and so on. Don't skip levels of the heading hierarchy. For example, in Markdown put an ### header only under a ## header. Don't have empty headings or headings with no associated content. Use a # heading for the page title. Links \u00b6 Use meaningful link text. Don't use click here or read this document . Don't force links to open in a new tab or window. Let the reader decide. Avoid adjacent links. Instead, find a way to separate them with one or more characters. If a link downloads a file, the link text must indicate this action as well as the file type. Images \u00b6 For every image, provide alt text that adequately summarizes the intent of each image. Don't present new information in images. Always provide an equivalent text explanation with the image. Use SVG instead of PNG if available. SVGs stay sharp when you zoom in on the image. Videos, recordings, and GIFs \u00b6 Provide captions, transcripts, or descriptions of audio and video content. For example, you can use the autocaption feature in YouTube.","title":"Accessibility"},{"location":"reference/style_guide/accessibility/#accessibility","text":"Write documentation with accessibility in mind.
