# Access Undenied NOQ FORK

`A little noq fork and pepper makes for a good meal`

## To update

`First of all: ask yourself if it's really necessary. We are editing the original files`

- Copy files from the repo: https://github.com/ermetic/access-undenied-aws into this folder (maybe with something like `cp -r * ../cloudumi/common/lib/aws/access_undenied`)
- Update `requirements.in` with any dep changes that were made in `requirements.txt`
