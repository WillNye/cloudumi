        In order to securely connect to your AWS Environment, Noq requires
        Cross-Account IAM Roles to be created in at least one of your accounts.
        Please read more about this here.
      </p>

      <p>
        If youâ€™re connecting a single account, we recommend that you use the AWS
        Console or AWS CLI, which will create the roles using CloudFormation and
        inform Noq when it is complete.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the roles are accessible, Noq will begin syncing your account data
        automatically.
