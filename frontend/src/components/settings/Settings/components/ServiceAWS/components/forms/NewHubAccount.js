            Your hub role is Noqâ€™s entrypoint into your environment. Whenever
            Noq attempts to gather information about your resources, update your
            resources, or broker credentials to your roles, it will first access
            your hub account with an external ID that is unique to your
            organization. Your hub account is an AWS account of your choosing
            that will be the entrypoint for Noq into your environment. Our
            onboarding process will walk you through the process of creating
            this role.
