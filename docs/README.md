## Installing

Ensure that you have Python3 installed. Create a virtual environment if you don't already have one:

`python3 -m venv env`
`. env/bin/activate`

Install mkdocs in your virtual environment:

`pip install mkdocs`

In the directory with `mkdocs.yaml`, run `mkdocs serve` to start the server. Visit `http://localhost:8000/` to
see the documentation.
